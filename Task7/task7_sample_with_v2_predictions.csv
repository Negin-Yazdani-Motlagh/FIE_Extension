The County of Riverside Department of Waste Resources has an opportunity for a Senior Civil Engineer to join the Engineering and Operations Division located in Moreno Valley.
The Senior Civil Engineer is the supervisory level classification in the registered civil engineer series and reports to an appropriate manager level position. The Senior Civil Engineer classification is characterized by registration as a Civil Engineer by the State of California Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists. Incumbents are given complete responsibility for a specific unit or team engaged in permitting, engineering, construction, and/or landfill operation activities.

The Riverside County Department of Waste Resources is responsible for the efficient and effective management of Riverside County’s solid waste system. In this effort the Department operates five non-hazardous landfills , has a contract agreement for waste disposal with a private landfill, and administers several transfer station leases. Landfill sites are in diverse geographic locations and climates, ranging from low desert areas to the mountains, which offer a wide variety of engineering challenges to keep ahead of the ongoing operational needs of a dynamic system. Stringent regulations require landfill operators to design, operate, monitor, and properly close landfills to provide protection of the public’s health and welfare. The Department ensures Riverside County has a minimum of fifteen (15) years of disposal capacity, at any time, to handle future solid waste projections. The Department has been a national leader in the design and construction of award-winning, multi-million-dollar landfill projects such as liner expansions, closures, site support facilities, traffic and drainage/stormwater quality improvements. The Department is organized so that nearly all functions of planning, design, permitting, operation, construction management, maintaining, and supporting the landfill system are performed by in-house staff. The Department currently has over 200 employees with a current year budget at approximately $157 million. Currently, the Department employs 20 engineers, of which 9 are California registered professional civil engineers, and 17 engineering technicians and aides. In addition to landfill management, the Department provides a variety of community services including Household Hazardous Waste Collection , Recycling , Composting , Community Outreach, Illegal Dumping Clean Up , Community Clean-Ups , and Graffiti Abatement .

Our Vision:
The restaurant will aim to serve as a community gathering place for family and friends to comfortably enjoy time together while sharing a carefully crafted and beautifully presented meal. Although the focus will be on the dine-in experience, a coffee bar/counter will also allow for take-out service where patrons can grab coffee, fresh pressed juice, and other breakfast items. The space provides a cozy yet refined environment, consisting of warm, earthy tones to create a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. Our goal for the menu is to provide upgraded classic favorites made primarily from organic, locally sourced ingredients.
Our Mission
is for our guests to know Scratchboard Kitchen as a haven where they will always be welcomed, where they can find carefully crafted and beautifully presented food & beverage offerings that are both nourishing and indulgent, and where they always experience excellent service that exceeds their expectations.

If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.
About Our Client
They're a fully-digital insurance company focused on small businesses. They develop their own unique insurance products from the ground up, and they combine that with software that automates the process to get covered and file claims. And they give business owners the tools they need to operate their business with less risk. As you can probably tell, they have a big goal and there is tons to do! :)
Their founding team has a track record in InsurTech and product development DNA, having most recently built a startup with 50 employees, serving the largest insurance companies in the world, and having raised over $39M in venture capital. You’ll be able to focus on the difficult task of building a world-class product based on market feedback from their customers and partners.
They want to build a world-class product and engineering culture in the Bay Area, and they’d like members of these teams to work in-person at least a few days per week. They trust that you’ll get your work done, the in-person is mostly about team building and culture.
Tech Stack: Go
About The Role
You'll own the backend architecture of our app. How do we keep a record of all changes and all data fields that go into insurance rate calculations? What’s the API between the frontend and backend look like? You will work closely with engineering, and product to understand the use cases and iterate on the backend.
You'll ship frequently as we iterate on the product. There's a lot of stuff we need to build! We're also probably not going to get features right the first time, so we're going to need to iterate quickly.
You'll delete and refactor a lot of code. It’s important to write code and ship, but it’s also important to remove code and make the codebase easier to work on. We care about making sure the codebase is well structured and as simple as possible so we can stay motivated and not feel drained after a day’s worth of work.
You'll set the tone for backend. As an early engineer, we will be looking to you to help realize our vision when it comes to the backend. You'll get to have a lot of say in engineering practices and how the backend is architected.

Every year, the legal system has made it difficult for millions of ordinary people to seek justice, especially for folks without means or who come from underrepresented backgrounds
. Our vision is to help these injury victims get the justice they deserve, irrespective of their income, demographics, or the quality of their legal representation.
EvenUp operates across all types of injury cases, from police brutality and child abuse to California wildfires and motor vehicle accidents. Our ML-driven software empowers attorneys to accurately assess the value of these cases by doing a core part of their workflow (legal drafting), enabling them to secure larger settlements in record time. As EvenUp evaluates more cases, our proprietary data grows, enhancing the precision of our predictions and delivering more value to both attorneys and victims alike.
As one of the fastest growing startups ($0 to $10M in ARR in <2 years), we raised $65M in investment from some of the best investors in the world (Bessemer, Bain Capital, Signalfire, DCM, NFX, Tribe Capital), seasoned tech executives (i.e. founder of Quora, SVP at Google, former CPO at Uber), and public figures that care about our social mission (Nas, Jared Leto, Byron Jones).

Now is the time to get on the ground floor as we scale!
We are looking for machine learning engineers who are passionate about building production machine learning products with a world-class team headed up by Matyas (lead early and foundational teams at Quora and Uber). You will have immense opportunities to work on a broad range of business/technical problems and technologies, build machine learning models, and design/automate/deploy production machine learning pipelines. We share a passion for problem-solving, new technologies, and learning, so you will be highly encouraged to explore new technologies and develop innovative solutions that could take the team's machine-learning engineering capability to the next level.

You will build and deploy machine learning models in production that tangibly impact the lives of our customers
You will be responsible for technical roadmaps and will collaborate with Product Management, Product Engineering, and Design to shape the overall product roadmap
You will be a strategic partner for leaders across the organization on driving business impact through machine learning
You will coach and mentor the next generation of strong engineers on the team
What we're seeking:
Experience building machine learning systems deployed to production
Industry or research experience in NLP, information retrieval, or entity resolution
Ability to communicate technical ideas or issues in easy-to-understand and actionable terms
Ability to translate theory and new ideas into practical shippable solutions
Thrive on data-driven development, always looking for ways to analyze and improve with data

About Our Client
Our client is on a mission to modernize the $220B+ Metal Service Center (MSC) industry – the backbone of America's industrial economy. Through our platform, we aim to transform the $1T metal value chain and digitize metal distribution throughout North America.
Metal Service Centers hold a pivotal position in the metal supply chain, processing and distributing half of the 88M tons of steel produced in the US annually. Essential industries depend on MSCs for everything from aircraft and skyscrapers to automobiles and medical devices. Despite their critical role, MSCs are held back by legacy software from the '70s and '80s, costing the industry over $10B in unrealized earnings each year.
Driven by their customer-centric philosophy, they are pioneering a modern ERP, purpose built to empower MSCs to boost revenue, slash costs, and save time. Our platform enables strategic inventory purchasing, streamlines manual tasks, improves the customer experience, ensures on-time deliveries, and accelerates sales growth.
Say goodbye to the ERPs of the past - join us in forging a new future.
